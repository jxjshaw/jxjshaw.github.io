        <h1 class="title-main-about"> </h1>
        <p class="lead"> <i> Airquail is the internet of things hardware startup that I cofounded. It started as a weekend hackathon project, and for 12 weeks it turned into a fulltime pursuit after we joined the Hackcelerator accelerator program. We're currently on our 3rd hardware prototype and have our devices in local school districts. </i></p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Story</h1>

        <p class="lead"> 
          Perhaps I should start this story like they do in some movies. We'll jump right into the climactic scene, pause it, tell the story of the build up, and then finally end with the decisive outcome.  </p>

          <p class="lead"> 
            So here I am nervously standing in front of 140 investors.  </p>

            <p class="lead"> What's going on? How did I get here? What's the plastic box that I have in my hand?</p>

            <h1 class="title-main-about"> *BEGIN FLASHBACK*</h1>
            
            <h1 class="title-main-about">Part 1: hardware product design</h1>
            
            
            <h1 class="title-main-about">Searching for product direction</h1>
            <p class="lead"> 
             If we were going to dedicate 3 months to building a product, it better be something we ourselves wanted to use. So although healthcare was a hot market, I strongly believed in focusing more on gases associated with comfort and wellness. We didn't want to be an alarm that monitors  toxic gas that will kills 50 people a year. On the other hand, we also didn't want to just monitor gases that will shorten your lives by 12 months. Instead, it's about telling people more about the gases that are always around you that you can't see and how they can unconsciously influence your lifestyle. <p>


             <h1 class="title-main-about">Searching for the right sensors</h1>
             <p class="lead">
              We went with Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Pm 2.5. We also added other sensors such as temperature, humidity, pressure for the sole purpose of making our primary gas algorithms more accurate.

     <!--    Hardware design

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Designing a functional enclosure</h1>

        <p class="lead">  Most startups hire an industrial design firm, but we're a little more scrappy than that so we designed and 3d printed our own enclosures. <p>

          

          <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/airquail/ca4.png" alt="Jeff" />

          <p class="lead">
           Small vents allowed for passive air diffusion. This worked well when the device just sat around to collect gradual changes. But for demo purposes and with certain gases requiring faster readings, we learned that on occasion an active intake was more ideal. 
           <p>
             

            <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/airquail/cad2.png" alt="Jeff" />
            <p class="lead">
             To meet our second goal we needed a portable device. That meant it had to have its own battery and be small enough to carry. Not much value in a device that just plugged into the wall and sat by the nightstand all day.
             <p>

              <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/airquail/h3.jpg" alt="Jeff" />

              
              <h1 class="title-main-about">The software</h1>
              <p class="lead"> 
                Unlike our competitors, we wanted our device to have (1) better integration with appliances and (2) better integration with user lifestyle. The first step to smart home integration was creating our own REST API that our own software, other devices, and appliances could read. <p>


                
                <h1 class="title-main-about">MVP</h1>
                <p class="lead"> 
                  Our first webapp was a functioning proof of concept. We started by pulling data from the EPA to compare with the data from our own device. Typing a zipcode returns data from public weather stations on dust and carbon monoxide levels. </p>


                  <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/airquail/app3.png" alt="Jeff" />

                  <h1 class="title-main-about">Restructured backend and frontend facelift</h1>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    After growing our product and technology, it became clear it was time for a more serious backend. We redid our device pairing and login system, support for historical data, more devices, more gas sensors, and new charts using c3.js. <p>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                     We also decided to kill our iOS app in testflight, so it was important to ensure usability of our webapp on mobile browsers. </p>

                     <h1 class="title-main-about">Part 3: field testing</h1>
                     <p class="lead"> 
                      For many weeks I carried one of our devices around without ever turning it off. Whenever I was in public, people would ask me about that thing in my hand. It was a lot of fun having these conversations, getting to know strangers, learning about their views on air quality (and of course adding them to our email list).
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="title-main-about">Part 3: installing our devices in schools</h1>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                      After testing in different homes and installing our device at a few schools, we ran into many unforseen obstacles. School and offices often have secured wifi networks that are hard for our device to connect with.

                    <h1 class="title-main-about">Pitching to investors</h1>
                    <p class="lead"> 
                      Being the leader in a startup is hands down the most challenging thing I have ever done. I had the privilege of working with the most talented and driven people in the world inside our company as well as throughout my accelerator batch. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="lead"> 
                      To say the least, I was very nervous.  pitching against the best hackers that literally flew in from around the world (Honduras, Russia, India, Nexico, UAE) pitching to 140 investors and some of the bigger partners on the judge panel.
