            <p class="lead">
              As a team, we grew up in some of the world's most polluted cities -- Shanghai, Bangalore, Warsaw, and the Central Valley. We knew people wanted clean air, but we didn't know how created their conception of clean air. </p> <p class="lead"> From a product stand point, my biggest challenge was taking people's conception of clean air, breaking that into physically measurable units for our hardware, and then turning those units back into naturally intuitive indicators of clean air for our users.

            <p class="lead">
              IoT devices become powerful when integrated into a cohesive environment. It was important for me to map out early on how the device interfaces with other home appliances as well as understand what overlaps there are between the readings from our device and the readings from public weather stations.

            <p class="lead">
              When creating the visual language, I wanted to keep the graphics organic and the indicators intuitive. Like many weather apps, I went with an animated environmental background. In our case, it gets more grey the more polluted our readings. I'm not a fan of separating each gas into its own chart, so in the future a goal is to plot out the relationship between gases.

                As the CEO sometimes the biggest design challenge wasn’t creating a product based on my instincts or user feedback, but instead identifying and articulating problems the entire team could stand behind and get excited about solving. The challenge wasn’t merely finding a market fit; it was giving our product, and in turn our company, a sense of direction and purpose.

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Designing a functional enclosure</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            <p class="lead">
               We wanted our device to have (1) better integration with user lifestyle and (2) better integration with smart appliances. <p>

               Creating small vents allowed for passive air diffusion. This worked well when the device just sat around to collect gradual changes. But for quick demos and with certain gases requiring faster readings, we learned that an active intake was more ideal.
               <p>

              <h1 class="title-main-about">The software</h1>


                  <p class="lead">

             To meet the first criteria, I focused on making our device more portable. It must have its own battery while being small enough to carry. Air quality is mostly important when it's relevant to our surrounding. In other words, I didn't see much value in building a device that plugs into the wall and sits by a nightstand all day.  <p>


                  <h1 class="title-main-about">Restructured backend and frontend facelift</h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                    After growing our product and technology, it was clearly time for a more serious backend. We overhauled our device pairing and login system. We added additional support for historical data, more devices, more gas sensors, and tried out a new chart style using c3.js. <p>

                    <p class="lead">
                     We also killed off our iOS app in testflight because we were spreading our time and effort too thin. Thus it became even more important to ensure webapp usability on mobile browsers. </p>

                     <p class="lead">
                      For many weeks I carried one of our devices around without ever turning it off. Whenever I was in public, people would ask me about that glowing box in my hand - most people thought it was some type of charging station . It was a lot of fun having these conversations, getting to know strangers, learning about their views on air quality (and of course adding them to our email list).

                    <p class="lead">
                      After testing in different homes and installing our device at a few schools around Sacramento, we ran into many unforseen obstacles. School and offices often have secured wifi networks that are hard for our device to connect with. <p>

                      <p class="lead">
                      In one instance, the school principle even used his own phone as a hotspot for connecting the device. Although the workarounds weren't always pretty, people were more tolerant than I anticipated because we were providing a better solution to monitor surrounding air quality.
