      <h1 class="title-main-about">Chimehack 2</h1>

      <p class="lead">Over the summer, I went to Chimehack2 with a few friends. It's a hackathon hosted by twitter to promote hacking for change.</p>

      <h1 class="title-main-about">Making College a Safer Space</h1>

      <p class="lead"> One of the categories for Chimehack was campus safety. To brainstorm, we thought back on our experiences with campus safety. Usually when your friend goes missing, they're not picking up their phone and you don't know whether or not their phone is dead. They're probably not in enough danger to call campus safety, but that doesn't mean you're not concerned for your friend. </p>

      <p class="lead"> That's why we built an iOS app called asOne. It's a better way to communicate in groups when going out. Instead of annoying group messages, we create temporary friend groups that shares information about each member's location, battery level, and the time they want to go home. </p>


      <h1 class="title-main-about">The Design Process</h1>   

      <p class="lead"> Because we had 48 hours to build everything, I had about 12 hours to work through the user flow and freeze visual design. We formed teams friday night. I spent the next morning designing and going through tough choices with my teamates. A little after lunch, I was ready to export the assets. </p>

      <p class="lead"> Usability was my key concern, so I spent a large chunk of my time refining the onboarding process. Because we were at twitter, we receieved a lot of feedback about the challenges when creating a product that only works  when many users choose to engage. They just started promoting Periscope at the time, and even for such an established company, we learned that there's really no way of knowig the success until it's out there.



        <p class="lead"> Here's a screenshot of the splash screen, illustrating the brand and styling.</p>
        <img class="content-image-vertical" src="../../images/projects/asone/a6.png" alt="Jeff" />
        <p class="lead"> One goal of Chimehack 2 was to promote inclusivness in technology. Likewise, the goal of our app was to make it easier for friend groups to stay together when out on a weekend. A key theme throughout the weekend was inclusiveness, so stylistically I wanted to convey friendliness and draw a diverse user base. To convey friendliess I went with warm passionate blends and a heart shaped logo. The best thing I could do to make sure we didn't attract the traditional tech-y user base was to make the app look less stereotypical, hence the granjon/roman typeface that you may recognise when walking around a mall...</p>   


        <p class="lead"> The resting screen</p>
        <img class="content-image-vertical" src="../../images/projects/asone/a1.png" alt="Jeff" />
        <p class="lead">  We used the facebook SDK when generating user accounts so our avators are pulled from our profiles. Key features include

          - displaying distance from friend based on location info
          - displaying battery life


          As well as user friendly conviniences such as

          - predefined status updates 
          - push notifications for entire group

          You can't see our our friend Revan's battery status because he has an adroid and we built this for iOS. We're all the same distance apart because we were standing next to eachother.

        <p class="lead"> Usually when you've assembled your group, there's one person missing. When calling doesn't work, we have an inline map that points you in the direction of that person. </p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Conclusion</h1>

        <p class="lead"> We built this app because this was a tool missing from our everyday lives, and for the rest of the summer we would often use it as a tool to ping and find eachother. Since then, Apple released a standalone friend finder, and we also saw an app named Companion gain popularity around college campuses. </p>

        <p class="lead"> In restrospect, the technology wasn't earth shattering, but this is a great example of how fast a talented team can work when there is good chemistry. In one weekend, we shipped a product that would take a company at least half a year to assemble.</p>
