        <p class="lead"> <i> This is the winning hackathon project that caught the attention of Daimler's board members. We had the chance to meet Dr. Z as well as all the other executives during their yearly meeting. They were extremely impressed, and subsequently what lead me to a job at Mercedes. </i> </p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> Simplifying the driving experience </h1>

         <p class="lead"> Lots of technology we take for granted on our phones are not utilized in cars. Mobile payment, for instance, is all around us. It's made our lives easier and more secure. Yet when leaving a parking garage or stopping at a toll booth, we still waste time and fumble to make a transaction.  <p>

          <img class="content-image" src="../../images/benzpay.gif" alt="Jeff" />

           <p class="lead">
          We're not getting from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible. That's why we created BenzPay, because for the Mercedes driver, time is the only currency that matters.  </p>

         <h1 class="title-main-about"> Boiling down the use case </h1>
         <p class="lead">  For our short demo, we paired down the concept to three distinct use cases. Speaking to drivers and industry experts, it became clear gas and parking were most popular. However there was no clear contender for the third use case, making it a harder decision. <p>

          <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/benzpay/a3.jpg" alt="Jeff" />

          <p class="lead">
          Not everyone was a fan of going with "events" instead of "tollbooth" but here is my reasoning:

          <ol type="1">
          <li>Payment sollutions for tollbooths already exist </li>
          <li>I want to appeal to the emotional side of our product. It's one thing to make your life easier, it's another to make it more interesting.  </li>
          <li>Quick to implement, completing transactions on ticketmaster or eventbrite requires no additional hardware or data collection - unlike support for parking meters, gas pumps, or toll booths. </li>
          </ol>
           </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Additional features include using gps and bitcoin to complete transactions without the need to stop, or by automatically calculating and paying for the price to fill up at a given gas station. 
            <p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> Driver usability: automate transactions </h1>     

        <p class="lead">  
        Designing for the car is different than designing for mobile. Unless the driver is parked, most interactions occur without the user's complete attention. That's why we made initiating a transaction automatic. All the driver needs to do is confirm the amount alerted to the driver. Bitcoin was the easiest to integrate for our prototype, but we soon discovered the security benefits of using bitcoin.

       
        <h1 class="title-main-about"> Driver usability: mapping input interaction </h1>    
        <p class="lead">  
        A common gripe from c300 owners is that the heads-up display looks like it's touchscreen but it really isn't. To avoid this confusion and make event handling more intuitive, I created an interface with a clear hierarchy of menus naviated through a selector. <p>

          <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/benzpay/a6.jpg" alt="Jeff" />


         <p class="lead">
        Rotating the wheel makes the selector scroll up, down, in and out of the menus depending on the context of the selector. Shifting the wheel left and right toggles different views like "payment history," "payment preferences," and "nearby transactions."
        <p>

         <h1 class="title-main-about"> Driver usability: glanceable interface </h1>         
        <p class="lead">  
        I used a variation of color, size, and weight to distinguish what really matters at a glance from information important only on a closer read. 
        <p>

            <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/benzpay/a5.jpg" alt="Jeff" />

              <p class="lead">  
                An example of this can be seen in the payment history view. The first thing the driver sees is the amount paid followed by the vendor name. Details such as credit card number and bitcoin address is more confidential and signifigantly less visible from a distance.  <p>
