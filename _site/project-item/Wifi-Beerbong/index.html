        <h1 class="title-main-about">Wifi Beerbong</h1>

        <p class="lead">Purely for fun project, no explaination needed. Built with particle.io, firebase, node, react. I mostly worked on the hardware. Basically the beer bong contains a flow sensor and a battery powered wifi arduino. When beer is chugged, we send a a post request with a timestamp over to our webapp. Webapp consists of leaderboard, user Id's done by facebook sdk.  <p>

         <p class="lead"> Clearly this wasn't going to be a 1-device-1-user sort of thing, more likely 1-device-1-friend group. A single device had to support multiple users, so it made sense to have a log in feature that integrated well with social media.   </p>

         <p class="lead"> The annoying thing with Particle (link) photons is that they run off 3.3v and a lot of sensors run off 5v. Since we were powering the photon with a usb battery pack, the original plan was to use that power with a voltage divider. I'm not an electrical engineer, but i just decided to just tap into the VIN of the photon. People were telling me not to do that, but it's been working as long as I make sure the ground is not floating around.  </p>

       <p class="lead"> The only resistors I ended up needing were for the led indicators.   </p>

         We short circuited everything on our first test. Luckily I had a seconded particle photon with me. Made sure our enclosure was waterproof.
