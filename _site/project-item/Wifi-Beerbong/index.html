            <p class="lead"> <i> People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware. </i></p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Inspiration</h1>

        <p class="lead"> I showed up to Mhacks 6 with a giant briefcase of hardware. It's really important for me to make things other people haven't, so whenever I find a novel gadget or sensor, I toss it in my hardware collection. <p>

          <p class="lead"> 
            I figured it would be fun to fly in a couple days early. It was the first week of classes and I had a couple of friends at the University of Michigan that I wanted to visit. Long story short, there was a block party, a bunch of people were standing on top of my friend's table and it snapped. <p>

             <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/beerbong/table.jpg" alt="Jeff" />

            <p class="lead"> 
            While looking for screws the next day at the hardware store, I come across something you would only see in Ann Arbor..... <i> In the gardening section there was an entire aisle dedicated to beer bong funnels, hoses, and accesories </i>. At that point, it became very clear to me that for Mhacks 6 I was going to make the world's first wifi enabled beer bong. <p>


         

        

              <h1 class="title-main-about">The world's first wifi enabled beerbong</h1>


          <p class="lead"> I had a lot of unanswered questions, so I started laying it all out. Where am I getting power? How am I going to display the data? How can I make drinking even more social?  </p>


         <p class="lead"> Clearly this wasn't going to be a 1-device-1-user sort of thing, more likely 1-device-1-friend group. A single device had to support multiple users, so it made sense to have a log in feature that integrated well with social media.   </p>

           <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/beerbong/f1.jpg" alt="Jeff" />


          <h1 class="title-main-about">Hardware constraints</h1>
         <p class="lead"> The annoying thing with Particle (link) photons is that they run off 3.3v and a lot of sensors run off 5v. Since we were powering the photon with a usb battery pack, the original plan was to use that power with a voltage divider. I'm not an electrical engineer, but i just decided to just tap into the VIN of the photon. People were telling me not to do that, but it's been working as long as I make sure the ground is not floating around.  </p>


       <img class="content-image" src="../../images/projects/beerbong/schem.jpg" alt="Jeff" />

       <p class="lead"> The only resistors I ended up needing were for the led indicators.   </p>

      <h1 class="title-main-about">Making sure it's water resistant</h1>
       <p class="lead"> I wasn't going to take any chances on shorting out the last board I had. Made sure this time nothing was hanging out in the open.   </p>

              <h1 class="title-main-about">Software was a failure</h1>

              <p class="lead">  I did not work on our software for this project. The only code I wrote was for the arduino. Nonetheless I still have an opinion about the software.<p>

                 <p class="lead">   Some features we just didn't get around to implementing. For instance, the score ranking. Other features, I think we could have been better off avoiding. In particular the facebook login. Although it's important for social games to link to social  profiles, I think there are easier ways for someone to login than to type in their facebook email and password. One option I would love to explore in the future would be installing a camera on the beerbong and leveraging facial recognition to tag participants.<p>

         We short circuited everything on our first test. Luckily I had a seconded particle photon with me. Made sure our enclosure was waterproof.
