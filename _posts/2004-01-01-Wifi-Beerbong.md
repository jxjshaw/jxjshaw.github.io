        <p class="lead">Purely for fun project, no explaination needed. Built with particle.io, firebase, node, react. I mostly worked on the hardware. Basically the beer bong contains a flow sensor and a battery powered wifi arduino. When beer is chugged, we send a a post request with a timestamp over to our webapp. Webapp consists of leaderboard, user Id's done by facebook sdk.  <p>

         We short circuited everything on our first test. Luckily I had a seconded particle photon with me. Made sure our enclosure was waterproof.
