                <p class="lead">

                In addition to increasing order frequency, I worked closely with our mobile engineers to elevate our culinary experience. Since joining we gradually raised the app store rating from 4.3 to 4.7 stars, rising to the list of 200 most downloads in the apple store for food & drink  </p>

                <!--
                                The strongest memory I have with Munchery is an interaction I had with a mobile engineer during a QA. It was the first feature I handed off, so I had something to prove and wanted everything to be perfect. and going back and forth about the fontsize and letterspacing on tablet. Tablet is something we don't prioritize, and so naturally the body text was slightly off. I apologized for the trouble it will take to make style changes to tablet independetly. But he told me it's okay because he's here to make 5 star apps. Since then our relationship has revovled around making 5 star apps. Whenever we're stuck on a decision I go back to making a5 star app. Admittedly sometimes we loose scope and bite off more than we can chew, but it's the commitment to craft and building sometinge exceptional that really inspires me to bring my best. -->

              <p class="lead"> When I joined leveraging data was my weakness, but it eventually became my strength. Designed and executed dozens of a/b and multi arm bandit experiments throughout different landing pages, menus, checkout pages. Some wins were easy (increased homepage conversion from 30% to 40% for ~8-10k users/day) but many were dead ends with insignificant findings. </p>

              <p class="lead"> I will always look back at Munchery and the time with our team very fondly. It was a great place to learn about product ownership and how design adds its value in a revenue driven environment. The product was popular enough that my contribution was very tangible and easy to quantify. yet the office was small enough that I developed unforgettable friendships while refining my craft across so many different areas of design. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
