        <p class="lead"> Back in college, I used to work in video production and post-production. Here are a few videos from work/fun. They've been featured on some of those hip underground sites.</p>

        

            

              <h1 class="title-main-about"> On the steps </h1>
              <!-- <p class="lead"> My favorite part about rappers is their work ethic - the hustle, the grind - having a dayjob and hitting the studio at night. I guess it's the same reason I love startups. It's about being young, living your dreams while everyones telling you your stupid. </p> -->

               <p class="lead">  Visually I wanted to extend the mood of the song. The shutter speed is slow to get that smooth motion blur, and the cuts are also slow. Shot at 35mm and 50mm wide open so its tight but soft. Didn't want to overdo camera movement, so  I kept things interesting with carefully planned sequenced lighting. I preserved the beautiful characteristics and colors from dim ambient light while adding very subtle reflected accents through sources such as my warm car blinkers or my cool phone flash covered by my finger.

              <p class="lead"> This one is your day in the life sort of editing structure. Most rap videos in recent years are shot on cropped sensors with tight lenses, resulting in a lot of camera shake remedied by fast cuts - it's a nice raw style. But this video looks different because many shots are of a much wider angle. The intro is way too long, and for the 10k views we got, half of them probably stopped watching it before the video even started. </p>
