        <p class="lead"> <i> When I was a college hipster, I worked in video production and post production. 
         Here are a few videos from work/fun.</i> </p> 

          


              <h1 class="title-main-about"> On the Steps </h1>
              <!-- <p class="lead"> My favorite part about rappers is their work ethic - the hustle, the grind - having a dayjob and hitting the studio at night. I guess it's the same reason I love startups. It's about being young, living your dreams while everyones telling you your stupid. </p> -->

               <p class="lead">  This track is slow, so everything from the shutter speed to the editing cuts are slow to keep the style smooth. <p>

                 <p class="lead">
                I used a tighter focal length to soften the surroundings. Lighting is very carefully planned, both in placement and timing, and is designed to melt in with dim ambient reflections.                </p>

              <h1 class="title-main-about"> S.O.S. </h1>
              <p class="lead"> In recent years, the most popular rap videos are shot on cropped sensors with tight lenses,  it's a nice raw style. <p>

                 <p class="lead"> 
                This video looks different because many shots are much wider. Wider lenses are great for high energy shots. Wider lenses allow for greater subject movement across the frame while reducing camera movement and shakiness. </p>

                 <p class="lead"> 
                In hindsight the intro I created was too long. For the 10k viewers of the video, half of them probably stopped watching it before the video even started. </p>
