        <p class="lead"> Back when I was a hipster, I worked in video production and post production. <p>

          <p class="lead">
         Here are a few videos from work/fun. They've been featured on some of those underground blogs.</p>

        

            

              <h1 class="title-main-about"> On the steps </h1>
              <!-- <p class="lead"> My favorite part about rappers is their work ethic - the hustle, the grind - having a dayjob and hitting the studio at night. I guess it's the same reason I love startups. It's about being young, living your dreams while everyones telling you your stupid. </p> -->

               <p class="lead">  This track is slow, so everything from the shutter speed to the editing cuts are slow to keep things smooth. <p>

                 <p class="lead">
                Used tighter focal length to soften the surroundings. Lighting is very carefully planned to melt in with dim ambient reflections.                </p>

              <h1 class="title-main-about"> SOS </h1>
              <p class="lead"> In the recent years, the most popular rap videos are shot on cropped sensors with tight lenses,  it's a nice raw style. <p>

                 <p class="lead"> 
                This video looks different because many shots are much wider. Fwiw, the intro is way too long, and for the 10k views we received, half of them probably stopped watching it before the video even started. </p>
