        <p class="lead"> Back in college, I used to work in video production and post-production. Here are a few videos from work/fun. They've been featured on some of those hip underground sites.</p>

              <p class="lead"> My favorite part about rappers is their work ethic - the hustle, the grind - having a dayjob and hitting the studio at night. I guess it's the same reason I love startups. It's about being young, living your dreams while everyones telling you your stupid. </p>

               <p class="lead">  Visually I wanted to extend the mood and message of the song. The shutter speed is slow to get that smooth motion blur, and the cuts are also slow. I wanted the shots to be tight but soft so I shot them at 35mm and 50mm wide open. I didn't want to use much camera movement, so instead I kept things interesting with the lighting that is carefully planned and constantly changing. At the same time, I wanted to preserve the beautiful characteristics and colors you get from dim ambient light, so I added very subtle reflected accents through sources such as my warm car blinkers or my cool phone flashlight covered by my finger.

              <h1 class="title-main-about"> SOS </h1>
              <p class="lead"> This one is your day in the life sort of editing structure. Most rap videos in recent years are shot on cropped sensors with tight lenses, resulting in a lot of camera shake remedied by fast cuts - it's a nice raw style. But this video looks different because many shots are of a much wider angle. The intro is way too long, and for the 10k views we got, half of them probably stopped watching it before the video even started. </p>

              <p class="lead"> Pickathon is Portland's largest music festival. Like everything in Portland, it's super underground and happens in a forest.</p>
