              <p class="lead">I work in the design studio at Mercedes Benz R&D Center North America, which is basically the branch responsible for business innovation, self driving, fuel cell technolgy, advanced design, etc. <p>



                <p class="lead"> More specifically, I'm on the Advanced UX ceoncepts and enablers team. I'm working on speech interaction and natural language stuff, kinda like siri. I can't show you what's actually been going down until maybe next year's CES, but you can have a look at some projects done by our team in the past: </p>
