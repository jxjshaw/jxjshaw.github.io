        <p class="lead"> <i> This is the winning hackathon project that caught the attention of Daimler's board members. We had the chance to meet Dr. Z as well as all the other executives during their yearly meeting. They were extremely impressed, and subsequently what lead me to a job at Mercedes. </i> </p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> The idea </h1>

         <p class="lead"> Mobile payment is all around us. It's made our lives easier and more secure. Yet when leaving a parking garage or stopping at a toll booth, we're still wasting time fumbling to make a transaction. That's why we created BenzPay, because for the Mercedes driver, time is the only currency that matters.  </p>

         <h1 class="title-main-about"> Simplifying the use case </h1>
         <p class="lead">  For our short demo, we paired down our application until we have three distinct use cases. Speaking to drivers and experts in the industry, it was clear gas and parking were the most popular. However there was no clear contender for the third use case, making it a harder decision. <p>

          <p class="lead">
          Not everyone was a fan of going with "events" instead of "tollbooth" but here is my reasoning:

          <ol type="1">
          <li>Payment sollutions for tollbooths already exist </li>
          <li>I want to appeal to the emotional side of our product. It's one thing to make your life easier, it's another to make it more interesting.  </li>
          <li>Quick to implement, completing transactions on ticketmaster or eventbrite requires no additional hardware or data collection - unlike support for parking meters, gas pumps, or toll booths. </li>
          </ol>
           </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Additional features include using gps and bitcoin to complete transactions without the need to stop, or by automatically calculating and paying for the price to fill up at a given gas station.

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> Designing on car interfaces </h1>     

        <p class="lead">  
        Designing for the car is different than designing for mobile. Unless the driver is parked, most interactions occur without the user's complete attention. That's why we made initiating a transaction automatic. All the driver needs to do is confirm the amount alerted to the driver. Bitcoin was the easiest to integrate for our prototype, but we soon discovered the security benefits of using bitcoin.

        <p class="lead">  
        Additionaly, not all cars (including this c300) support touch input, so there must be a clear hierarchy when navigating through each menu. To increase usability, we disabled left and right toggling on the car's touchpad, and instead mapped each input to either up, down, enter, and back.
        <p>

        <p class="lead">  
        Ensuring readability also means ensuring it's an interface easy to glance over.  One example of this can be seen in the payment history view. Only the most relevant information is made visible, while information such as the unique bitcoin address is subdued by default.
