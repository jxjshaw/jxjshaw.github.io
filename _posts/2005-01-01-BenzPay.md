        <p class="lead"> <i> This is the winning hackathon project that caught the attention of Daimler's board members. We had the chance to meet Dr. Z as well as all the other executives during their yearly meeting. They were extremely impressed, and subsequently what lead me to a job at Mercedes. </i> </p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> The idea </h1>

         <p class="lead"> The idea is that mobile payment is all around us. It's made our lives easier and more secure. Yet when leaving a parking garage or stopping at a toll booth, for some reason we're still wasting time fumbling for money or trying to stick a card in a machine. That's why we created BenzPay, because for the Mercedes driver, time is the only currency that matters.  </p>

         <h1 class="title-main-about"> Simplifying the use case </h1>
         <p class="lead"> We didn't have much time to do our demo so I narrowed down the use cases to the three most important to a driver. Gas and parking are hands down the most important, but the final use case was much harder to choose. <p>

          <p class="lead">
          I eventually went with events instead of toll booths for a couple reasons:

          <ol type="1">
          <li>There are already existing payment sollutions for tollbooths. </li>
          <li>We wanted to appeal to an emotional side of our product. It's one thing to make your life easier, it's another to make it more interesting.  </li>
          <li>Quick to implement, completing transactions on ticketmaster or eventbrite requires no additional hardware unlike support for parking meters, gas pumps, or toll booths. </li>
          </ol>
           </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Other features include using gps and bitcoin to complete transactions without the need to stop, or by automatically calculating and paying for the price to fill up at a given gas station.

        <h1 class="title-main-about"> Designing on car interfaces </h1>     

        <p class="lead">  
        Designing applications for the car is a little different than designing applications for the phone or the web. Unless the driver is parked, most interactions occur without the user's complete attention. That's why payments are automatically triggered by location and unique pairing. Everything is automatic, and all the driver needs to do is confirm the amount alerted to the driver. Bitcoin was the easiest to integrate for our prototype but the concept to support other payments is the same.<p>

        <p class="lead">  
        Additionaly, not all cars (including this c300) support touch input, so there must be a clear hierarchy when navigating through each menu.
        <p>

        <p class="lead">  
        Ensuring readability also means it's an interface easy to glance over.  This is an image of the payment history view. Only the most relevant information is made visible, and thus the bitcoin address is barely visible.
