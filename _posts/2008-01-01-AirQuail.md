        <h1 class="title-main-about">AirQuail</h1>
        <p class="lead"> Airquail is the internet of things hardware startup that I cofounded. It started as a weekend hackathon project that turned into a fulltime pursuit after we joined Hackcelerator, a 12 week accelerator program during the summer. We're currently on our 3rd hardware prototype and have our devices in local school districts for testing purposes.</p>

        Just a disclaimer, i might be talking more about business problems than issues purely with product design.

        Our time and resources are limited, so we made some tough decisions on which combinations of gases we wanted to monitor. Early on, when making decisions about the product, it's not always about the customer, the market, or what's usable. If we were going to dedicate our lives to building a product, it better be something we ourselves wanted to use. So although healthcare was a hot market, I strongly believed we should focus more on gases associated with comfort and wellness. We don't want to be an alarm that monitors that monitors that toxic gas that will kills 50 people a year, and we also didn't want to just monitor gases that will shorten your lives by 12 months. Instead, it's about telling people more about the gases that are always around you yet you can't see and how they can unconciously influence your lifestyle. So that's why we went with Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Pm 2.5. We also added other sensors such as temperature, humidity, pressure for the sole purpose of making our primary gas algorithims more accurate.

        Hardware design
        It had to be portable, why we selected wifi , form factor and costs $90

        Software
        We had an ios app and webapp and showed epa data blablalbalbalal
