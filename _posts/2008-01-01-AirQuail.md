        <p class="lead"> <i> Airquail is the internet of things hardware startup that I cofounded. It started as a weekend hackathon project, and for 12 weeks it turned into a fulltime pursuit after we joined the Hackcelerator accelerator program. We're currently on our 3rd hardware prototype and have our devices in local school districts. </i></p>

                 <h1 class="title-main-about">Overview</h1>

        <p class="lead"> 
          This piece is focused more on the project process rather than the design details. Although I was the team designer, I was also the startup CEO. Thus my version of the story is skewed towards how everything came together rather than how every unique problem was solved.  </p>

          Perhaps I should start this story like they do in some movies. We'll jump right into the climactic scene, pause it, tell the story of the build up, and then finally end with the decisive outcome.  </p> -->

          <p class="lead"> 
            To start off, here's a clip of me providing some background. There were 140 investors in the crowd and I was very nervous.  </p>

            <h1 class="title-main-about">Searching for product direction</h1>
            <p class="lead"> 
             With all the work we were putting in without taking out salary, it was important that we didn't forget about building a device that we ourselves would be excited to use. So although health and medical was a hot market, I strongly believed in focusing more on gases associated with comfort and wellness. We didn't want to be an alarm that monitors toxic gas that will kills 50 people a year. On the other hand, we also didn't want to just monitor gases that will shorten your lives by 12 months. Instead, it's about telling people more about the gases that are always around you that you can't see and how they can unconsciously influence your lifestyle. <p>


             <h1 class="title-main-about">Searching for the right sensors</h1>
             <p class="lead">
              After picking apart competing products, speaking with sensor manufactures in Chinese and Korean, we settled on an initial sensor suite. The gases we monitor include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and pm 2.5. In addition, we included other values such as temperature, humidity, pressure for the sole purpose of accurate calibration.

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Designing a functional enclosure</h1>

        <p class="lead">  Most startups hire an industrial design firm, but we're a little more scrappy than that. For these initial prototypes, we designed and 3d printed our own enclosures. <p>

          <p class="lead">
           Creating small vents allowed for passive air diffusion. This worked well when the device just sat around to collect gradual changes. But for quick demos and with certain gases requiring faster readings, we learned that an active intake was more ideal. 
           <p>

               <p class="lead"> 
                Unlike our competitors, we wanted our device to have (1) better integration with user lifestyle and (2) better integration with smart appliances. <p>

              <h1 class="title-main-about">The software</h1>
           

                  <p class="lead">
              
             To meet the first criteria, we made our device more portable. It must have its own battery while being small enough to carry. Air quality is mostly important when it's relevant to our surrounding. In other words, I didn't see much value in building a device that plugs into the wall and sits by a nightstand all day.  <p>
                
                <h1 class="title-main-about">MVP</h1>
                <p class="lead"> 

                   The first step towards smart home integration was creating our own REST API that our own software, other devices, and appliances could read. <p>

                     <p class="lead"> 
                  Our first webapp was a functioning proof of concept. We started by pulling data from the EPA to compare with the data from our own device. Typing a zipcode returns data from public weather stations on dust and carbon monoxide levels. </p>

                  <h1 class="title-main-about">Restructured backend and frontend facelift</h1>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    After growing our product and technology, it was clearly time for a more serious backend. We overhauled our device pairing and login system. We added additional support for historical data, more devices, more gas sensors, and tried out a new chart style using c3.js. <p>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                     We also killed off our iOS app in testflight because we were spreading our time and effort too thin. Thus it became even more important to ensure webapp usability on mobile browsers. </p>

                     <h1 class="title-main-about">Field testing</h1>
                     <p class="lead"> 
                      For many weeks I carried one of our devices around without ever turning it off. Whenever I was in public, people would ask me about that glowing box in my hand - most people thought it was some type of charging station . It was a lot of fun having these conversations, getting to know strangers, learning about their views on air quality (and of course adding them to our email list).

                    <h1 class="title-main-about">Installing our devices in schools</h1>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                      After testing in different homes and installing our device at a few schools around Sacramento, we ran into many unforseen obstacles. School and offices often have secured wifi networks that are hard for our device to connect with. <p>

                      <p class="lead"> 
                      In one instance, the school principle even used his own phone as a hotspot for connecting the device. Although the workarounds weren't always pretty, people were more tolerant than I anticipated because we were providing a better solution to monitor surrounding air quality.

                     I still can't get over myself for being steamrolled by the judges. I totally froze being asked questions that I totally saw coming. Everything worked out in the end, but I'm still traumautized by the those 30 seconds.
