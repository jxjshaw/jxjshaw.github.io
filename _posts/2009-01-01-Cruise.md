       <h1 class="title-main-about">Vision</h1>


      <p class="lead">asOne is a low effort way to communicate with people you are out with. Instead of overwhelming chat groups, we share information about each member's location, battery level, and the time they want to go home without waiting for a response. </p>

            <p class="caption"> The main goal was taking the friction out of communication </p> -->



        <h1 class="title-main-about">Creating trust and protecting privacy</h1>  

         <p class="lead"> Usability and the onboarding process was a key concern in my design. Nobody was going have this app at their fingertips, if it was hard to sign up, log in, and immediately delivering value. Because we were at twitter, we received fantastic feedback about the challenges facing products that only works when many users buy into the system. <p>



         <p class="lead">
          The key drawback to with leveraging existing profiles is potential concerns over user privacy. Our remedy was a system where formed groups only last until the next morning. To use the app again, a new group must be created. To minimize friction in this process, we included recent and nearby friends at the top of the contact list.<p>

           <p class="caption"> Users seeking privacy can leave the group early</p>


                       <h1 class="title-main-about">Creating a distinct visual style</h1>  

                     <p class="lead"> Inclusiveness was a major theme throughout both Chimehack and the mission our technology. Using our app is essentially making a pact within your friends. To embody this feeling of warmth, unity, and trust in a visual language, I designed a logo with a symmetrical heart pattern that blends warmly together. </p>





        <h1 class="title-main-about">Collaborating with engineers</h1>  

        <p class="lead"> Usually when everyone's ready to go home, there's that one person that nobody can find. So I designed a detailed extension to the group view. Tapping on the friend brings you to more actions such as sending a push notification and enabling audio. Additionally we automatically set the true north of the inline map to that of the selected friend. </p>

        <h1 class="title-main-about">Conclusion</h1>

        <p class="lead"> We built this app because this was a tool missing from our everyday lives. For the rest of the summer we would often use it as a tool to ping and find eachother. Since then, similar apps such as Friend Finder and Companion have made their way into the market. </p>

        <p class="lead"> In retrospect, the technology wasn't earth shattering, but this is a great example of how fast a talented team can work decisively when there is good chemistry. In one weekend, we shipped a polished product that could have taken some people half a year.</p>
